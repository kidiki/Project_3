Project_3 : Oscillators: 

This program investigates the physical system acting as harmonich oscillators. The user is free to choose the initial conditions of the system. The script uses the method odeint to solve the differential equation charachterising the motion and then generates a pdf file containing how the system evolves with time for different values of the driving frequency and another pdf file containing a plot of the resonance amplitude wrt the driving frequency.
